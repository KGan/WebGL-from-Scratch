Simplex Noise on Canvas
=======================

[Wikipedia]:
_"Simplex noise is a method for constructing an n-dimensional noise function comparable to Perlin noise ("classic" noise) but with a lower computational overhead, especially in larger dimensions. Ken Perlin designed the algorithm in 2001[1] to address the limitations of his classic noise function, especially in higher dimensions."_

Abstact
-------

Cover a surface with organic-looking noise. We are only aiming for 2D noise
here, though the principle is the same, other dimensions are to come later.


High level
----------

Consider the surface to be covered with equilateral triangles (with all sides of
same length) and have each corner point have a random influence. Let us have
each corner point represented by a black and white linear gradient. Of course,
each corner only affects the pixels close to it.

For mathematical simplicity, we will make the triangles so that their sides
together make 45 degree lines. See the sample or [Simplex Noise Demystified]
for a graphical representation.  


Technical
---------

For setup we will create a random set of corner points. We don't want
them to change in the middle of rendering.

Then for each pixel we do the following:

  1.  Scale the pixel to create an effect of wanted dimensions.
  2.  Skew the pixel onto the rectangular grid.
  3.  See on which tile it lands.
  4.  Each tile is two triangles, figure out on which of the triangles it landed.
  5.  Skew back onto the triangular grid.
  6.  Get the gradients for all corner points of this triangle.
  7.  Calculate and add the effects the cornerts points have on this pixel.
  8.  Return the value between -1 and 1.
