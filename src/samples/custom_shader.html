<p>In practice, it seems likely many people will use great custom effects provided by shaders that will expose easily configured parameters, as in the previous example.

    Writing shaders, while taking some practice is not that difficult. Also, and this is a little known secret, they are a lot of fun to author.

    Shaders are written in the OpenGL ES shading language, the same language used for WebGL shaders. Here is the vertex shader example that creates the wobble effect from the previous example.

    For those not familiar with shaders, the following terminology definitions should help read the examples:

    Vertex: A coordinate on the geometry processed by the shaders.
    Texture: A raster image (offscreen image). CSS shaders turn an element's rendering into a texture that is used and processed by the vertex and fragment shaders.
    Attributes: Per-vertex parameters, passed to the vertex shader
    Uniform: Global parameters that have the same value for all vertices and pixels. They are passed from the custom() function to the shaders.
    Projection Matrix: A matrix converting coordinates from the normalized vertex coordinate range ([-0.5, +0.5] along each axis) back to the actual viewport coordinate system. Typically used in the vertex shader.</p>
